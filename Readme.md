## 🎙️ Smart Audio Monitor

Smart Audio Monitor is an intelligent audio recording app designed to make capturing conversations, meetings, and key audio moments seamless and efficient. Instead of recording everything continuously, this app only records audio when it matters — when sound is detected above a set decibel threshold — and automatically stops during silence.

### 🚀 Features

- Smart Monitoring: Automatically starts recording when audio exceeds a certain decibel level.
- Automatic Pause & Resume: Pauses during silence and resumes when sound is detected again.
- Multiple Audio Clips: Generates separate audio files for each segment of detected sound.
- Can be used for: AI-Powered Transcription: Instantly send recordings to an AI assistant to generate:
    - Accurate transcriptions  
    - Concise meeting notes  
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple, clean, and focused on productivity.

### 🛠️ How It Works

- Start Monitoring: Tap the "Start Monitoring" button.
- Smart Capture: The app listens passively and only records audio when it detects sound above the configured decibel level.
- Segmented Recordings: Each audio segment is saved individually, allowing for more organized and manageable files.
- Review Outputs: View or download transcriptions, meeting summaries, or action items derived from the audio.
